The effect hooks lets you perform side effects in functional components 
It is a close replacement for componentDidMount,didUpdate,willUnmount


take an example of class component life cycle method

componentDidMount(){
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    this.interval = setInterval(this.tick , 1000)
}

componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval)
}

Here is first thing to observe 
-- To update the document title we are writing the same code twice
once in componentDidMount and another in componentDidUpdate

Second thing to observe
-- The code setInterval and clearInterval which are related are put into differnt code blocks
-- The code to update the dom and setInterval put together whicha are completely unrelated are put together
