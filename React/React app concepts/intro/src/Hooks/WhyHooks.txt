Why Hooks 
1. Reason Set 1
Understand how this keyword works in js . Avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword if uses hooks
Remember to bind handlers in class components 
Classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unreliable

2. Reason set 2 
there is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
Hoc and render props patterns do address this problem
Makes the code harder to follow
there is need a to share stateful logic in a better way

3. Reason set 3
Create component for complex secnarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events
Related code is not organized in one place 
Ex. Data fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
ex: Event listeners - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
Because of stateful logic - cannot break component into smaller ones
