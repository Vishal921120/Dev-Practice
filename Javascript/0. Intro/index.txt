1. Js can change html content, attributes, styles, can hide and show the elements 
   using document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";

2. Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed,
   because script interpretation slows down the display.

3. Putting external script as follows <script src="myScript.js"></script>.
    Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

4. JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

    Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
    Writing into the HTML output using document.write(). For testing purpose. Shouldn't use after html loaded bcz it will delete all html
    Writing into an alert box, using window.alert(). we can use it without window as well
    Writing into the browser console, using console.log(). for debugging purpose.

5. JavaScript Programs
    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
    In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
    A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
    let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
    x = 5;          // Statement 2
    y = 6;          // Statement 3
    z = x + y;      // Statement 4

6. In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables
    An equal sign is used to assign values to variables

7. A JavaScript name must begin with:

    A letter (A-Z or a-z)
    A dollar sign ($)
    Or an underscore (_)
    Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

8. 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
    Using var
    Using let
    Using const
   
9. In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
   The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
   Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
   If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

10. In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. 
    The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
    A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

11. If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
    You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.

12. The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
    Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.
    Variables defined with let must be declared before use.
    Variables defined with let have block scope.
        Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
        ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
        These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
        Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block

13. Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.
    Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:
    var x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

    {
    var x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
    }

    // Here x is 2


    Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.
    Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:
    let x = 10;
    // Here x is 10

    {
    let x = 2;
    // Here x is 2
    }

    // Here x is 10

14. The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).
    Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
    Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
    Variables defined with const have Block Scope.

15. When to use JavaScript const?
    Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.
    Use const when you declare:

    A new Array
    A new Object
    A new Function

16. The keyword const is a little misleading.

    It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.
    Because of this you can NOT:
        Reassign a constant value
        Reassign a constant array
        Reassign a constant object
    But you CAN:
        Change the elements of constant array
        Change the properties of constant object

17. When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), 
   they are computed from left to right:

18. When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
    let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo"; // output 20Volvo 
    let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4 ; // output Volvo164
    In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".
    In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.

19. Here is a list of some common HTML events:

    Event	    Description
    onchange	An HTML element has been changed
    onclick	    The user clicks an HTML element
    onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
    onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key
    onload	    The browser has finished loading the page

20. Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.
  let x = new String("John");
  let y = new String("John"); 
  x==y/ x===y gives you false;

21. Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
    The method is called string interpolation.   The syntax is: ${...}

    let firstName = "John";
    let lastName = "Doe";
    let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;
